## Overview
Each document focuses on a specific GitFlow scenario and provides detailed instructions for handling different situations, such as:

- **Feature Development**: Creating and merging feature branches into `develop`.
- **Hotfixes**: Applying critical fixes directly to `main` and synchronizing with `develop`.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Managing integration conflicts when multiple features are being merged.
- **Feature Reversion**: Reverting problematic features after multiple releases.
- **Unplanned Merges**: Handling mistakes when a feature is merged into the wrong branch.
- **Release Management**: Managing release branches when last-minute changes create conflicts.
